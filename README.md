# Wedding-Website
Website to highlight my journey of learning CSS/ HTML and Javascript. Aim to create a functional website with interesting web design elements.
This is the first project that i am creating on my journey to becoming a front end web developer.
Aim:
Create a functional, well designed wedding website that can be used for my own wedding.

Technical:
- Main aim is to incorporate my own design ideas into reality with CSS and being able to use, change and work with Bootstrap.
- Develop my Javascript journey by trying to incorporate as many java script elements as possible, which can then also be used as an
encyclopedia for Javascript code for myself.
